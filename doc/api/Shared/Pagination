    1. "offset" - integer.
        Specifies number of records to skip.
        If omitted, offset = 0

    2. "seed" - float. Should belong to the interval [0, 1].
        Specifies the random sorting order with a specific seed to prevent duplicates on different pages.
        If omitted, sorting order will be by "created_at desc" (newest records come first)

    Limit is always 20 and cannot be changed through parameters.
